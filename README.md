I am a recent double Master's graduate in Human-Computer Interaction and Design, with a specialization in UX/UI and a strong foundation in Computer Science and Digital Innovation. I completed my degrees after studying in Athens, Madrid, and Paris, where I developed a passion for enhancing user experiences through technology and human-centered design.

I am actively seeking opportunities in areas closely aligned with Front-end or Full-Stack Development, UX/UI design, or Product Design. My goal is to apply my technical skills and design expertise to build innovative, user-friendly solutions that allow me to learn and grow, all while making a meaningful impact in people's lives.
